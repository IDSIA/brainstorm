| **Discontinuation Notice**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Brainstorm is no longer being maintained, so we recommend using one of the many other,available frameworks, such as Tensorflow or Chainer. These and similar large projects are supported much more actively by a larger number of contributors.  They provide, or plan to provide many available and planned features of brainstorm, and have several advantages, particularly in speed. In order to avoid fragmentation and waste of effort, we have decided to discontinue the brainstorm project and contribute to other frameworks and related projects such as [Sacred](https://github.com/IDSIA/sacred) instead.  Many thanks to everyone who contributed! For us it has been a thoroughly enjoyable and educational experience. |

Brainstorm makes working with neural networks fast, flexible and fun.

Combining lessons from previous projects with new design elements, and written entirely in Python, Brainstorm has been designed to work on multiple platforms with multiple computing backends.


Getting Started
---------------
A good point to start is the brief [walkthrough](https://brainstorm.readthedocs.org/en/latest/walkthrough.html) of the ``cifar10_cnn.py`` example.  
More documentation is in progress, and hosted on [ReadTheDocs](https://brainstorm.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
If you wish, you can also run the data preparation scripts (``data`` directory) and look at some basic examples (``examples`` directory).

Status
------
Brainstorm is discontinued. 

The currently available feature set includes recurrent (simple, LSTM, Clockwork), 2D convolution/pooling, Highway and batch normalization layers. API documentation is fairly complete and we are currently working on tutorials and usage guides.

Brainstorm abstracts computations via *handlers* with a consistent API. Currently, two handlers are provided: `NumpyHandler` for computations on the CPU (through Numpy/Cython) and `PyCudaHandler` for the GPU (through PyCUDA and scikit-cuda).

Installation
------------

### Ubuntu:

```bash
# Install pre-requisites
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-dev libhdf5-dev git python-pip
# Get brainstorm
git clone https://github.com/IDSIA/brainstorm
# Install
cd brainstorm
[sudo] pip install -r requirements.txt
[sudo] python setup.py install
# Build local documentation (optional)
sudo apt-get install python-sphinx
make docs
# Install visualization dependencies (optional)
sudo apt-get install graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config
[sudo] pip install pygraphviz --install-option="--include-path=/usr/include/graphviz" --install-option="--library-path=/usr/lib/graphviz/"
```
To use your CUDA installation with brainstorm:
```bash
$ [sudo] pip install -r pycuda_requirements.txt
```
Set location for storing datasets:
```bash
echo "export BRAINSTORM_DATA_DIR=/home/my_data_dir/" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Windows (7, 8.x, 10): 

**Before installation:**

- You will need a copy of MinGW (version 4.7.x or later) installed and properly configured on your machine. To learn about installing MinGW, see [MinGW - Getting Started](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started).
- If you have a 64-bit machine, you will need to install the 64-bit Windows binary package for H5PY that matches your version of Python from Christoph Gohlke's [Collection of Windows Binaries](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#h5py).

**To install:**

```bash
git clone  https://github.com/IDSIA/brainstorm
cd brainstorm
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r pycuda_requirements.txt [Only if you have PyCUDA installed!]
python setup.py install
```

**Post-Installation:**

Add `BRAINSTORM_DATA_DIR` to your System Variables, pointing to a location of your choice.

**CUDA Requirements:**

[TO DO: WHEN I get this up and running on ASUS laptop, also make separate following paragraph of what’s needed for that, which will hopefully be:]

- CUDA 7.0 or later
- PyCUDA 2015.1.3
